abstract = {National demand for electricity follows a regular and predictable daily pattern. This pattern is set to change due to efficiency improvements, de-industrialisation and electrification of heat and transport. These changes are independent of renewable infeed and are not well understood: Contemporary studies assume that electricity load curves will retain their current shape, scaling equally in all hours. Changes to this shape will profoundly affect the electricity industry: Increasing the requirements for flexible and peaking capacity, and reducing asset utilisation and profitability. This paper explores the evolution of load curves to 2050 in Germany and Britain: Two countries undergoing radically different energy transformations. It reviews recent developments in Europe's electricity demand, and introduces two models for synthesising future hourly load curves: ELOAD (electricity LOad curve ADjustment) and DESSTinEE (Demand for Energy Services, Supply and Transmission in EuropE). Both models are applied to a decarbonisation scenario for 2050, and consistently show peak loads increasing by about 23{\%} points above the change in annual demand, to 103 GW in Germany and 92 GW in Britain. Sensitivities around electrification show that a million extra heat pumps or electric vehicles add up to 1.5 GW to peak demand. The structure and shape of the future load curves are analysed, and impacts on the national electricity systems are drawn.},

abstract = {The unbundling of formerly vertically integrated utilities in liberalized electricity markets led to a coordination problem between investments in the regulated electricity grid and investments into new power generation. At the same time investments into new generation capacities based on weather dependent renewable energy sources such as wind and solar energy are increasingly subsidized with different support schemes. Against this backdrop this article analyzes the locational choice of private wind power investors under different support schemes and the implications on grid investments. I find that investors do not choose system optimal locations in feed-in tariff schemes, feed-in premium schemes and subsidy systems with direct capacity payments. Consequently, inefficiencies arise if transmission investment follows wind power investment. A benevolent transmission operator can implement the first-best solution by anticipatory investment behavior, which is however only applicable under perfect regulation. Alternatively a location dependent network charge for wind power producers can directly influence investment decisions and internalize the grid integration costs of wind power generation.},

abstract = {Governments occupy a significant proportion of building stock and their associated annual water and energy costs can be substantive. Research has shown that significant reductions in energy and water consumption as well as carbon emissions can be achieved through retrofitting public buildings. However, in most countries the current retrofitting rate is very low due to a number of barriers, including a lack of supportive legislation, regulations, guidelines, industry capacity and financial mechanisms. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the barriers as well as the best international practices covering numerous aspects of public building retrofits. Among others, the most important barriers identified were a lack of consideration of the water-energy nexus, and the limited availability of effective financing mechanisms. With a particular focus on the Australian context, a strategic roadmap, as well as a number of recommendations, such as the use of revolving loan fund financing and energy performance procurement, have been developed that aim to foster a greater rate of implementation of energy and water retrofit projects for public buildings. Achievement of such an aim will not only reduce ongoing operational costs of public buildings, but also lower their environmental impact and generate new employment opportunities.},

The architecture enables real-time monitoring and control and supports electric vehicle (EV) charging at scale. The ACN adopts a flexible Adaptive Scheduling Algorithm based on convex optimization and model predictive control and allows for significant over-subscription of electrical infrastructure. We describe some of the practical challenges in real-world charging systems, including unbalanced three-phase infrastructure, non-ideal battery charging behavior, and quantized control signals. We demonstrate how the Adaptive Scheduling Algorithm handles these challenges, and compare its performance against baseline algorithms from the deadline scheduling literature using real workloads recorded from the Caltech ACN and accurate system models. We find that in these realistic settings, our scheduling algorithm can improve operator profit by 3.4 times over uncontrolled charging and consistently outperforms baseline algorithms when delivering energy in highly congested systems.},

   abstract = {Development of accurate transposition models to simulate plane-of-array (POA) irradiance from horizontal measurements or simulations is a complex process mainly because of the anisotropic distribution of diffuse solar radiation in the atmosphere. The limited availability of reliable POA measurements at large temporal and spatial scales leads to difficulties in the comprehensive evaluation of transposition models. This paper proposes new algorithms to assess the uncertainty of transposition models using both surface-based observations and modeling tools. We reviewed the analytical derivation of POA irradiance and the approximation of isotropic diffuse radiation that simplifies the computation. Two transposition models are evaluated against the computation by the rigorous analytical solution. We proposed a new algorithm to evaluate transposition models using the clear-sky measurements at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL's) Solar Radiation Research Laboratory (SRRL) and a radiative transfer model that integrates diffuse radiances of various sky-viewing angles. We found that the radiative transfer model and a transposition model based on empirical regressions are superior to the isotropic models when compared to measurements. We further compared the radiative transfer model to the transposition models under an extensive range of idealized conditions. Our results suggest that the empirical transposition model has slightly higher cloudy-sky POA irradiance than the radiative transfer model, but performs better than the isotropic models under clear-sky conditions. Significantly smaller POA irradiances computed by the transposition models are observed when the photovoltaics (PV) panel deviates from the azimuthal direction of the sun. The new algorithms developed in the current study have opened the door to a more comprehensive evaluation of transposition models for various atmospheric conditions and solar and PV orientations.},

   abstract = {Radiative transfer (RT) models simulating broadband solar radiation have been widely used by atmospheric scientists to model solar resources for various energy applications such as operational forecasting. Due to the complexity of solving the RT equation, the computation under cloudy conditions can be extremely time consuming though many approximations (e.g. two-stream approach and delta-M truncation scheme) have been utilized. Thus, a more efficient RT model is crucial for model developers as a new option for approximating solar radiation at the land surface with minimal loss of accuracy. In this study, we developed a fast all-sky radiation model for solar applications (FARMS) using the simplified clear-sky RT model, REST2, and simulated cloud transmittances and reflectances from Rapid Radiation Transfer Model (RRTM) with a sixteen-stream Discrete Ordinates Radiative Transfer (DISORT). Simulated lookup tables (LUTs) of cloud transmittances and reflectances are created by varying cloud optical thicknesses, cloud particle sizes, and solar zenith angles. Equations with optimized parameters are fitted to the cloud transmittances and reflectances to develop the model. The all-sky solar irradiance at the land surface can then be computed rapidly by combining REST2 with the cloud transmittances and reflectances. This new RT model is more than 1000 times faster than those currently utilized in solar resource assessment and forecasting since it does not explicitly solve the RT equation for each individual cloud condition. Our results indicate the accuracy of the fast radiative transfer model is comparable to or better than two-stream approximation in term of computing cloud transmittance and solar radiation.},

BIPVs are divided into different groups, PV-sunshade (PVSDS) type of which is targeted in present study. PVSDS can be used in residential buildings to contribute significantly to the economic costs of the building by saving the building's electricity consumption. The use of solar panels in buildings is useful when it is economically viable. For this purpose, in this study, a multi-objective optimization is performed to simultaneously reduce the annual cost of electricity consumption and the cost of installing window glass and PV system by applying photovoltaic shadows installed on the building window. To initiate multi-objective optimization, six design variables based on the position and geometry of the photovoltaic shade are selected and energy simulations are performed through EnergyPlus software for 5 cities with different climates in Europe. Design variables and objective functions are identified in JEPLUS (Java+ EnergyPlus) software, then the NSGA-II algorithm is employed for optimization which results in the several optimal points on a Pareto Front. Based on the climatic condition of the city, a specific optimal point on the Pareto Front is attributed to that city. The results show that 17 to 34 % in the cost of electricity consumption of the building is saved by choosing a suitable solar shading between. Also, the static payback period is obtained in a period of 1.5 to 6 years for different cities. It is also construed that the tilt angle of PV shading in cities that are further from the equator is higher.},

A series of wind tunnel experiments have been performed to evaluate wind loads on solar panels on flat roofs, mainly focusing on module forces calculated from area-averaged net pressures on solar modules of a standard size. In order to investigate the module force characteristics at different locations on the roof, solar array models, which were fabricated with pressure taps installed as densely as possible, were moved from place to place. Design parameters including tilt angle and distance between arrays, and building parameters including building depth and parapet height, have also been considered. The results show that unfavorable negative module force coefficients for single-array cases are much larger than those for multi-array cases; tilt angle and distance between arrays increase negative module forces; effects of building depth and parapet height on negative module forces are not obvious; and recommendation values in JIS C 8955 Standard correctly estimate negative mean module force coefficients but not peak values. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},
