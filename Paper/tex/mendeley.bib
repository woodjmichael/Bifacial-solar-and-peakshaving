abstract = {National demand for electricity follows a regular and predictable daily pattern. This pattern is set to change due to efficiency improvements, de-industrialisation and electrification of heat and transport. These changes are independent of renewable infeed and are not well understood: Contemporary studies assume that electricity load curves will retain their current shape, scaling equally in all hours. Changes to this shape will profoundly affect the electricity industry: Increasing the requirements for flexible and peaking capacity, and reducing asset utilisation and profitability. This paper explores the evolution of load curves to 2050 in Germany and Britain: Two countries undergoing radically different energy transformations. It reviews recent developments in Europe's electricity demand, and introduces two models for synthesising future hourly load curves: ELOAD (electricity LOad curve ADjustment) and DESSTinEE (Demand for Energy Services, Supply and Transmission in EuropE). Both models are applied to a decarbonisation scenario for 2050, and consistently show peak loads increasing by about 23{\%} points above the change in annual demand, to 103 GW in Germany and 92 GW in Britain. Sensitivities around electrification show that a million extra heat pumps or electric vehicles add up to 1.5 GW to peak demand. The structure and shape of the future load curves are analysed, and impacts on the national electricity systems are drawn.},

@article{Wagner2019,
abstract = {The unbundling of formerly vertically integrated utilities in liberalized electricity markets led to a coordination problem between investments in the regulated electricity grid and investments into new power generation. At the same time investments into new generation capacities based on weather dependent renewable energy sources such as wind and solar energy are increasingly subsidized with different support schemes. Against this backdrop this article analyzes the locational choice of private wind power investors under different support schemes and the implications on grid investments. I find that investors do not choose system optimal locations in feed-in tariff schemes, feed-in premium schemes and subsidy systems with direct capacity payments. Consequently, inefficiencies arise if transmission investment follows wind power investment. A benevolent transmission operator can implement the first-best solution by anticipatory investment behavior, which is however only applicable under perfect regulation. Alternatively a location dependent network charge for wind power producers can directly influence investment decisions and internalize the grid integration costs of wind power generation.},

abstract = {Governments occupy a significant proportion of building stock and their associated annual water and energy costs can be substantive. Research has shown that significant reductions in energy and water consumption as well as carbon emissions can be achieved through retrofitting public buildings. However, in most countries the current retrofitting rate is very low due to a number of barriers, including a lack of supportive legislation, regulations, guidelines, industry capacity and financial mechanisms. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the barriers as well as the best international practices covering numerous aspects of public building retrofits. Among others, the most important barriers identified were a lack of consideration of the water-energy nexus, and the limited availability of effective financing mechanisms. With a particular focus on the Australian context, a strategic roadmap, as well as a number of recommendations, such as the use of revolving loan fund financing and energy performance procurement, have been developed that aim to foster a greater rate of implementation of energy and water retrofit projects for public buildings. Achievement of such an aim will not only reduce ongoing operational costs of public buildings, but also lower their environmental impact and generate new employment opportunities.},

This work introduces a stochastic weather generator called the multi-scenario extreme weather simulator (MEWS) that produces credible future heat waves. MEWS calculates statistical parameters from historical weather data and then shifts them using climate projections of increasing severity and frequency. MEWS is demonstrated using the EnergyPlus medium office prototype model for climate zone 4B using five climate scenarios to 2060. The results show how changes in climate and heat waves affect electric loads, peak loads, and thermal comfort with uncertainty.},

With rapid resource shrinkage, energy management has recently become an essential concern for all smart environments. Energy management aims to assure ecosystem sustainability, while benefiting both consumers and utility providers. Although energy management emerged as a solution that addresses challenges that arise with increasing energy demand and resource deterioration, further evolution and expansion are hindered due to technological, economical, and social barriers. This review aggregates energy management approaches in smart environments and extensively reviews a variety of recent literature reports on peak load shaving and demand response. Significant benefits and challenges of these energy management strategies were identified through the literature survey. Finally, a critical discussion summarizing trends and opportunities is given as a thread for future research.},

   abstract = {We describe the architecture and algorithms of the Adaptive Charging Network (ACN), which was first deployed on the Caltech campus in early 2016 and is currently operating at over 100 other sites in the United States. The architecture enables real-time monitoring and control and supports electric vehicle (EV) charging at scale. The ACN adopts a flexible Adaptive Scheduling Algorithm based on convex optimization and model predictive control and allows for significant over-subscription of electrical infrastructure. We describe some of the practical challenges in real-world charging systems, including unbalanced three-phase infrastructure, non-ideal battery charging behavior, and quantized control signals. We demonstrate how the Adaptive Scheduling Algorithm handles these challenges, and compare its performance against baseline algorithms from the deadline scheduling literature using real workloads recorded from the Caltech ACN and accurate system models. We find that in these realistic settings, our scheduling algorithm can improve operator profit by 3.4 times over uncontrolled charging and consistently outperforms baseline algorithms when delivering energy in highly congested systems.},

This paper briefly reviews the complete package of surface observations, models, and satellite data used for the latest version of the NSRDB as well as improvements in the measurement and modeling technologies deployed in the NSRDB over the years. The current NSRDB provides solar irradiance at a 4-km horizontal resolution for each 30-min interval from 1998 to 2016 computed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL's) Physical Solar Model (PSM) and products from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES), the National Ice Center's (NIC's) Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2). The NSRDB irradiance data have been validated and shown to agree with surface observations with mean percentage biases within 5% and 10% for global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and direct normal irradiance (DNI), respectively. The data can be freely accessed via https://nsrdb.nrel.gov or through an application programming interface (API). During the last 23 years, the NSRDB has been widely used by an ever-growing group of researchers and industry both directly and through tools such as NREL's System Advisor Model.},

A possible solutions is offered by the Demand Response (DR) management, aiming to reduce the total load demand of the distribution system during peak periods in order to maintain the integrity of the network and stability of the whole system. The paper analyses different scenarios based on real data from the distribution grid of Milan (Italy), evaluating benefits and costs of DR implementation in three different plants, to solve problems related to feeders congestion, power losses, and voltage drops, through either the scheduling or remote control of distributed resources. Moreover, load shape considerations suggests the possibility to integrate in the system a higher share of photovoltaic (PV) generation, of which the effects on DR are also evaluated in the paper.},
